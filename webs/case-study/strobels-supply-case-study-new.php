        <h2>Business Brief:</h2>
        <p>Strobels Supply, an online business, began back in the 1940s as a family business. They started by supplying trusted products in New York's Southern Tier Region and for mass transit (like trains and buses). Over time, they grew and became a trusted supplier of transit systems all over the country. Then, in 2003, the company changed owners after being run by two generations of the same family. In 2019, Strobels adapted to new changes related to technology and other advancement. They sell various products, including chemical sprays, coating, 3M Matic accessories, compound & polishes,  footwear, and more. </p>

        <h2>Problem Description:</h2>
        <h3>Improving Website Speed for Better User Experience</h3>
        <p>A fast website is really important because it makes users happy and helps the website appear in Google. Sadly, Strobels, a big company in the industrial supply distribution and liquid paint industry, had a slow website. All their web pages, like the homepage, product pages, and about us pages, took too long to load. This made it frustrating for people to use their website, and more of them left without doing anything. It also made their brand look bad online.</p>
        
        <p>While there are regular ways to make a website faster, Strobels needed a special solution to get the best results.</p>


        <h2>The Solution We Offered:</h2>
        <h3>Making Strobel's Website Faster to Improve Their Online Reputation</h3>
        <p>First, we checked how fast Strobels 's website was loading. We looked closely at how well the homepage, collection, product, and about us pages were doing before we made any improvements.</p>

        <p>Our main job was to make the website load faster and fix issues that were slowing it down. This would make Google visit the site more often. We told the client about our special tool that could make their website load faster. It's a tool you use online, and it quickly makes the website load faster by fixing issues.</p>

        <p>Strobels gave us the green light, so we added a custom-made piece of code to their website. This code started fixing things that were slowing the website down. It mostly worked on organizing things that were blocking the page from loading quickly.</p>

        <p>Our tool also stopped unnecessary scripts from running and made sure things like JavaScript and CSS were used efficiently. This helped the website do well on important measures of website quality. The best part is it did all of this in just a few seconds.</p>

        <p>Our tool also made images load smarter by waiting to load them until you needed to see them. It also cleaned up extra code that wasn't necessary. This made the website load even faster.</p>

        <p>After fixing everything on Strobels 's website, we saw big improvements in how fast the pages loaded on both phones and computers. Remember, a faster website means a better experience for users.</p>

        <p>One great thing about our WebsiteSpeedy tool is how quickly it improves a website. In just a few minutes, it can make a big difference in how well Strobels 's website performs.</p>

        <h3>The Results Since We Started Working On The Project </h3>
        <p>After we carefully looked at Strobels's website using our tool and fixed the problems we found, we saw some really good improvements on all their pages. This meant that more people were buying from them, which shows that having a faster and smoother website is very important.</p>

        <p>Here's how the Strobels website did before and after we used our WebsiteSpeedy tool:</p>
