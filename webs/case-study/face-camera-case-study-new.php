        <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
        <h3>Overcoming The Speed Problems To Load Your Website In A Flash</h3>
        <p>In today’s digital world, it is crucial to have a website that does not take longer than 3 seconds to load. A website that loads quickly provides a better user experience to the visitor than a website that takes a long time to load. A user does not wait longer than 10 seconds to see if the website is loading properly and if not, then your user will have a negative experience accessing your brand.</p>
        <p>Such was the issue with Face cam, they were having trouble with the speed of their website due to which they were facing issues of low sales and visitors. The sudden decline in the number of sales affected their online business in a certain way. The brand reached out to us with their issues and with our expertise on the matter, we were successfully able to find the reasons behind the slow speed.</p>



        <h2>Solution: </h2>
        <h3>Rectifying The Issues Of The Website And Significantly Working On Them To Build the Brand’s Online Presence</h3>

        <p>Before implementing anything for the website or suggesting anything to the brand owner, we did our own research and tried to understand the difficulties of the website. We ran a test to know the loading speed of the website pages.</p>
        <p>We checked the performance of the home page, collection page, product page, and about us page before optimization. It was important for the website to reduce the loading time and work on the website pages according to their requirements. Once we were aware of the complete requirements of the website, we had a discussion with the client about our website speed optimization tool, website speedy.</p>
        <p>Website Speedy is a SaaS-based <a href="https://websitespeedy.com/">website speed optimization tool</a> that works on the issues slowing down your website and instantly increases its speed to provide a better user experience. Once the client said okay to use our tool for their website, we started with the implementation of our custom hard-coded script, and we started working on the issues to enhance the speed of the website. The script started looking for the elements affecting the performance of the website and blocked them for a better loading website. </p>

        <p>To achieve better results, Our tool is designed to optimize images through the implementation of lazy loading and the removal of redundant code from websites. Additionally, it effectively delays the loading of non-critical resources until user interaction is detected, resulting in improved loading times. After successfully fixing all the assets on Face cam's website, we witnessed notable enhancements in page speed scores across various browsers and devices, both on mobile and desktop platforms.</p>


        <h2>Results Since We Started: </h2>

        <p>After analyzing the speed of the website and understanding the issues behind slow loading affecting the experience of the user, we used the tool to significantly improve the speed. This helped in increasing the number of sales through our website.</p>
