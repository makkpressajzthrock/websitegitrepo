Before starting with the optimization efforts, we monitored the performance scores for various pages, including the homepage, blog page, and about us page. The focus was on reducing loading times and addressing render-blocking issues for these specific pages, as this would positively impact the number of pages indexed by Google's crawlers.</p>
