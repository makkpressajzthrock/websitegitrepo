                    <h2>Business Brief:</h2>
                   <p>Nailary was founded by an experienced manicurist with a vision to make professional-grade nail care accessible to everyone. The brand's ultimate mission is to empower individuals to achieve healthy and beautiful nails. Nailary boasts a carefully curated selection of products, including nourishing cuticle oils, long-lasting bases, gels, and a vast array of gel polish shades. The brand's primary objective is to offer our clients top-notch nail care commodities in the market that can assist them in obtaining outcomes akin to those obtained from a professional salon.</p>

                    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
                    <h3>Uncovering All The Hindrances To Boost Website's Loading Speed</h3>
                    <p>A fast website load time is crucial for every website because it impacts user experience and SEO. Unfortunately, Nailary's website was lacking in this area. Upon discovering the importance of page speed, the brand checked its website's performance on page speed tools and found that its score was quite low. From the home page to the collection page, product page, and about us page, each page took a considerable amount of time to load. This directly impacted their user experience, increased their bounce rate, and negatively affected their online presence. Nailary reached out to us for the same and wanted us to implement solutions that could help them improve their website's loading speed for all pages.</p>


                    <h2>Solution:</h2>
                    <h3>Improving the Brand's Online Presence With Our Effective Website Speed Boosting Tool</h3>
                    <p>To ensure optimal website performance, we first assessed the loading speed of Nailary's homepage, collection page, product page, and about us page. By identifying and addressing render blocking issues and reducing loading times, we aimed to increase the number of pages crawled by Google. During our consultation with the client, we introduced our powerful <a href="https://websitespeedy.com/">website speed optimization tool,</a> a SaaS-based solution that instantly rectifies any assets slowing down the website. With this tool, Nailary can expect a significant improvement in website loading times and overall performance.</p>
                    <p>After convincing the brand to try our website speed-boosting tool, we immediately implemented our custom hard-coded script onto their website. Our automated script began identifying and reorganizing render-blocking elements to enhance the website's DOM. The Website Speedy tool effectively blocked third-party scripts and minimized the impact of unused JS and CSS, resulting in impressive green core web vitals. Thanks to our tool, the client's website saw a significant boost in speed and overall performance.</p>
                    <p>To enhance the website's performance, the tool optimizes your content and utilizes lazy loading eliminating unnecessary code from your images. After fixing all the assets on Nailary's website, we were thrilled to see a significant improvement in the page speed scores across all browsers on both mobile and desktop devices. Our team went the extra mile to ensure the preview theme was thoroughly tested on all major devices and browsers, and we're happy to report that it's functioning flawlessly. Thanks to our Website Speedy Tool, we were able to automate the optimization process, resulting in lightning-fast website performance for Nailary in just a matter of minutes.</p>
