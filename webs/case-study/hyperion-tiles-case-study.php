                    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
                    <h3>Hyperion Tiles Website Is Struggling With Poor Store Loading Speed</h3>
                    <p>Being excellent in terms of user experience, satisfaction, and timely delivery, Hyperion Tiles still needed to get more sales. There are many reasons behind the site’s sales, but the prime cause was the slow loading speed. Hyperion Tiles store takes too long to load on the user’s browser, and it was the reason that affected its revenue.</p>

                    <p>So, after going through multiple manual ways to optimize website speed, Hyperion Tiles was still unhappy with the issue. Thus, they reached out to us to fix this problem and boost their website loading speed and sales.</p>
                
                    <h2>Solution Offered:</h2>
                    <h3>Finding Major Issues And Improving Speed With Website Speedy</h3>
                    <p>Therefore, after going through the whole Website, we analyzed that there are many things that slow down store speed, such as big and uncompressed images, too many HTTP requests, heavy scripts, and many other things. Apart from that, browser caching, CDN, and many additional things were affecting their website performance.</p>
                    <p>Thus, after identifying them, we added our tool script to their customer website. After that, the script started improving its store performance and fixing the major issues. The process took some time. Our tool removes unnecessary scripts from the store and HTTP requests and eliminates render-blocking issues from the Website. Additionally, the Website started losing the essential data first, then the rest. </p>
                    <p>Our Website Speedy tool performed really well and fixed all the issues that the Website was having. Our SaaS-based speed optimization tool boosted the Hyperion Tiles store speed and improved their performance. </p>
