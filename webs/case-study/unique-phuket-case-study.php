                    <h2>Business Brief:</h2>
                    <p>Our business was started with the goal to provide affordable and well-organized weddings and events in Phuket, Thailand, specifically catering to weddings in Phuket. We strive to meet or exceed customer expectations without compromising on quality. We have established partnerships with various Phuket events and wedding partners who join us in promoting the services of Unique Phuket Wedding Planners worldwide.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the years, we have successfully organized destination weddings in Phuket and have had the pleasure of working with exceptional vendors. Our strong relationships with these vendors ensure that wedding couples receive the best service for their special event.</p>


                    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
                    <h3>How Website Speed Interrupted With People’s Wedding Plans</h3>
                    <p>A user is looking for a seamless experience when they are browsing through your website. Who would want to look through a slow-loading website? This would interrupt highly with their user experience and it is possible that the user leaves your website looking for a faster-loading website.</p>
                    <p>Unique Phuket was going through the same issue of slow website speed leading to fewer sales and visits to the website. The contents of the website were not loading completely and if they did, it took more than 3 seconds for the website to load completely. They wanted to resolve the issue as soon as possible but couldn’t find the right way to do so, which is why they connected with us.</p>
                    


                    <h2>Solution:</h2>
                    <h3>How Our Thorough Research Of The Website Reduced The Loading Time Of The Website</h3>
                    <p>We started the optimization process by thoroughly researching the speed of each page of the website through different mediums. We evaluated their homepage, collection page, product page, and about us page to assess their current loading speed.</p>
                    <p>We were majorly focusing on identifying and addressing any render blocking issues and reducing loading times, ultimately improving the number of Google-crawled pages. Another concern raised by the client was how we would enhance their loading speed. We introduced them to our own powerful website speed optimization tool, a SaaS-based solution designed to quickly address problematic assets.</p>
                    <p>We informed them about how our tool has compatibility with all major ecommerce platforms. To improve page speed, we not only focused on optimizing the website's content but also optimized images by implementing lazy loading and removing redundant codes.</p>
                    <p>We also delayed loading non-essential resources until user interaction was detected, greatly enhancing loading time. After optimizing all the assets of the website, our tool generated impressive page speed scores for all browsers on mobile and desktop devices. With our advanced optimization techniques, we ensure that your website operates faster and more efficiently than ever before, without any effort required on your part.</p>
                    <p>Next, our team set up the speed optimization parameters and implemented the Website Speedy script on the website. The script autonomously identified and reorganized any elements that were blocking rendering, resulting in a significant improvement in the overall performance of the website. Additionally, our tool effectively blocked unnecessary third-party scripts and minimized the impact of unused codes, leading to the successful achievement of green core web vitals.</p>
