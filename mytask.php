Yes, BunnyCDN provides logs and analytics that can help you track the number of times a file is loaded from their CDN. BunnyCDN offers a feature called "Access Logs" that provides detailed logs for every request made to your content.
To enable access logs in BunnyCDN, you need to enable the "Access Logs" feature for your pull zone. Once enabled, BunnyCDN will start generating logs for each request made to your files. These logs can include information such as the requested file, timestamp, client IP address, response status, and more.
By analyzing the access logs, you can gather insights about the number of times a specific file is loaded from the CDN. You can filter the logs based on the requested file path or URL and count the occurrences to track the file's usage.
Keep in mind that enabling access logs may have a minimal additional cost and require proper log processing and analysis to extract the desired information effectively. Refer to BunnyCDN's documentation or reach out to their support for detailed instructions on enabling and accessing the access logs feature.

As of my last update in September 2021, BunnyCDN, a content delivery network service, does not provide a built-in feature to check the bandwidth used by a single file directly through their user interface or API. However, you can estimate the bandwidth usage of a file by using the following steps:

Check the file size: If you know the size of the file, you can calculate the bandwidth usage by multiplying the file size (in bytes) by the number of times it has been accessed or downloaded.

412
Check the CDN logs: Some CDN providers, including BunnyCDN, provide access logs that contain information about requests made to your files. These logs may include data like the number of requests for each file and the data transferred. You can analyze these logs to calculate the bandwidth used for specific files.
To view the access logs on BunnyCDN, you'll need to enable them in your BunnyCDN dashboard. Once enabled, the logs are usually available for download or accessible via FTP.
Keep in mind that features and capabilities of CDN providers may change over time, so it's best to check with BunnyCDN directly or review their documentation to see if any new features related to bandwidth monitoring or file-specific statistics have been introduced since my last update.

can I define which server location I want the file to upload for first time in bunnycdn?

As of my last update in September 2021, BunnyCDN provides a feature called "Storage Zones," which allows you to specify the preferred server location for the initial upload of your files. By using Storage Zones, you can ensure that your files are initially stored in a specific geographical region.
Here's how you can set up Storage Zones in BunnyCDN:
Log in to your BunnyCDN dashboard.
Click on the "Storage Zones" option in the left-hand menu.
Click the "Create New Storage Zone" button.
Give your Storage Zone a name and select the geographical region where you want your files to be initially uploaded to.
After creating the Storage Zone, you'll receive a specific URL endpoint for that zone. You can use this URL to upload your files, and they will be stored in the selected geographical region.
Keep in mind that once the files are cached on BunnyCDN's global network, they will be distributed to multiple edge locations worldwide, and subsequent requests for those files will be served from the closest edge server to the end-users. The initial storage location mainly affects the first-time upload, and BunnyCDN's smart caching mechanism takes care of optimizing the delivery for subsequent requests.
Please note that features and settings in BunnyCDN might have been updated or changed since my last update. Therefore, I recommend checking BunnyCDN's official documentation or reaching out to their support team for the most up-to-date information on this feature.
